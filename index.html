											<h2>River side theatre, </h2>
											<h2> London 2018 </h2>

										</header>
									<p>
											The design is created from both a conceptual approach and a constructional logic.
											Designed on a 120 degree angled grid, a foyer space connects two theatres. A large formal theatre carefully designed into
											a hexagonal concrete prism and a more intimate theatre space within a reimagined Tudor building.
											Within the concrete hexagonal prism in the design is a 320 seater formal theatre with a balcony. Access to both spaces is via
											a layered wall on the perimeter,
											leaving an uninterrupted view of the stage from every seat.
									<p>
											The venue is acoustically adaptable to accommodate various sound engineering requirements for different to types of production and music genres.
											The concrete walls can be left exposed or dampened with a curtain.  Wooden panelling line the walls of the theatre space.
											The stage itself can be used for the formal theatre but can also act as a stage for an outdoor audience on the boardwalk of the river Thames.
									<p>
											The intimate theatre is located within an existing Tudor building on the site, with only the external structure of the original building
											being retained.  A new layer within the structure creates the 50 seater space.  The building can be accessed by a front entrance
											or through the foyer space on the ground floor.  Visitors are initially greeted by a ticket booth and bar/lounge area, advancing through to
											the theatre itself is on the first floor with itsâ€™ double height space providing access for the necessary lighting equipment and production props.
									<p>
											A series of pre-cast concrete walls layer the foyer space and create individual spaces between these layers.
											They interact differently depending on where they are in the design.  The idea of compression and release is evident throughout the project.
											Entering the foyer on ground level an upper floor plate is always above you, natural light is intended to shine in from the elevations of
											the building and as you progress into the building the idea of natural light changes as it starts to penetrate the diamond gridded roof structure
											over a voided multi-purpose space.  This space is another potential theatre at the core of the design.
											It has a gradual sloped concrete floor sunk into the ground, this leaves one end higher than the other where a platform could be used as a stage.

									<h2>ARCHIVE/STUDENT CENTRE 2017</h2>

								<p>
									A waterfront archive space on the UL campus.
									After examining the campus and deciding the type of space I wanted to create I made the decision where my archive
									would be located.The axes that the campus
									is built on I felt was a key concept that would connect my design to the main heart of the campus regardless of
								  the distance between.This let me use the space onlong that axes on the rivers edge which intersects the
						  		 pedestrian pathway to the city of Limerick. This led me to the idea of creating a new entrance to the campus.
